#+TITLE: Base Crypt

Simple crypto-algorithm that uses number bases to crypt message
* Example
  The best way to understand this is through hex numbers.

  base-16 alphabet: =0123456789abcdf=

  base-16 message: =bad=

  Now we change number base, from 16 to 10 (decimal)

  base-10 alphabet: =0123456789=

  base-10 result: =2989=

  Or, from 16 to 8 (octal)

  base-8 alphabet: =01234567=

  base-8 result: =5655=

  Our messages are just numbers in some base. By changing number bases, we alter
  our message. We just use larger bases (like 95, all ascii printable
  characters).
